/*ðŸ’   ASSIGNMENT 

1. Declare a variable name and assign your name to it. Then print the value.
2. Declare a variable age and assign your age to it. Print "I am X years old" using concatenation.
Â» Where X will display whatever value you assigned to the variable "age"
3. Create two string variables, firstName and lastName. Concatenate them and store them in a new variable: fullName and then print it.
4. Use template literals (interpolation) to print: "Hello, my name is X and I am Y years old."
Â» Where X and Y are variables you ve declared and initialized with any value of your choice.
5. Declare a variable city, and print "I live in [city]." using both concatenation and interpolation respectively.
6. Declare a variable score. And write a program such that if it's above 50, it will print "You passed!", otherwise it will print "You failed!".
7. Declare temperature. If it's above 30, print "It's hot!", if between 20 and 30, print "Nice weather.", otherwise print "It's cold!".
8. Create an array fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], then print the second item.
9. Create an object person = {name: "John", age: 25, city: "New York"}, then print the age.
10.Create an empty array tasks. And then add "Exercise", "Study", "Sleep" to it using the appropriate array method.
11. Declare and initialize any variable of your choice using this value : ["2025", "02", "22"].
Write a program that will convert the array above to "2025-02-22" when printed.
Â» What you're expected to do is that, instead of the array being separated by commas, it should be seperated by hyphens.*/
